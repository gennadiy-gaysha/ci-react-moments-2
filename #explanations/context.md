### Initial User Check in `App.js`
1. **Fetching Current User on App Mount:** Upon the initial mounting of the `App` component, it attempts to fetch the current user's data with an Axios GET request to `"/dj-rest-auth/user/"`. This is done in the `handleMount` function that is called within a `useEffect` hook.
   ```jsx
   const { data } = await axios.get("/dj-rest-auth/user/");
   setCurrentUser(data);
   ```
   Here, `setCurrentUser(data)` sets the `currentUser` state with the data retrieved from the server, assuming `data` is the user object.

### Sign-In Process in `SignInForm.js`
2. **User Sign-In:** During the sign-in process within the `SignInForm.js` component, a POST request is sent to `"/dj-rest-auth/login/"` with `signInData` (username and password). Upon successful sign-in, the server responds with user data.
   ```jsx
   const { data } = await axios.post("/dj-rest-auth/login/", signInData);
   setCurrentUser(data.user);
   ```
   This is where `setCurrentUser(data.user)` is called, updating the `currentUser` state with the user object returned from the sign-in endpoint. This step directly updates the `currentUser` context value throughout the application.

### Consuming the `currentUser` in `NavBar.js`
3. **Consuming `currentUser` in NavBar:** The `NavBar` component consumes the `CurrentUserContext` to access the `currentUser` state. This allows the `NavBar` to adjust its UI based on whether a user is logged in or not.
   ```jsx
   const currentUser = useContext(CurrentUserContext);
   ```
   The `NavBar` "accepts" or reflects the value of `currentUser`, which could have been set either on the initial app load (step 1) or after a successful sign-in operation (step 2).

### Summary of the Corrected Sequence
- **Initial Load:** On the app's initial load, `App.js` tries to fetch the current user data and set it to `currentUser` using `setCurrentUser(data)`.
- **Sign-In Process:** In `SignInForm.js`, upon a successful sign-in, `setCurrentUser(data.user)` updates the `currentUser` state with the new user data from the sign-in response.
- **Consumption in NavBar:** `NavBar.js` consumes the `currentUser` state to adjust its UI dynamically based on the user's sign-in status.

The `setCurrentUser` function is a crucial link in this sequence, acting as the mechanism to update the `currentUser` state across the application, reflecting the current user's information in components like `NavBar` that consume this context.
